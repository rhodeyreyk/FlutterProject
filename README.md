## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Flutter** (Latest version with SDK ^3.8.1)
- **Firebase Core** (v2.24.2) - Firebase initialization
- **Firebase Auth** (v4.16.0) - Email & password authentication
- **SQLite** (sqflite v2.3.0) - Local database storage
- **Provider** (v6.1.1) - State management
- **Intl** (v0.19.0) - Date formatting
- **Shared Preferences** (v2.2.2) - User preferences storage

## 🚀 How to Run the App

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (3.8.1 or higher)
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter extensions
- Android/iOS emulator or physical device

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Eye-que/FlutterProjStudentFlow.git
   cd FlutterProjStudentFlow
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Firebase Setup** (Required for authentication)
   
   Run the FlutterFire CLI to configure Firebase:
   ```bash
   dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
   flutterfire configure --project=student-task-manager-4bc6a --platforms=android
   ```
   
   This will automatically:
   - Generate `lib/firebase_options.dart` with Firebase configuration
   - Configure your `google-services.json` file
   - Set up Firebase for your Android app

   **Note:** The app is already configured with Firebase. If you're setting up on a new machine, follow the steps above.

4. **Run the App**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Building APK

To build a release APK:
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

The APK will be generated at `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

### Firebase Configuration Note
The app is designed to work with Firebase Authentication. After you provide the `google-services.json` file, the authentication features will be fully functional. The app will still compile and run without Firebase configuration, but authentication won't work until Firebase is properly set up.
